HTML5 Cross Platform Game Development Using Phaser 3
====================================================

Reworked examples from Emanuele Feronato's [HTML5 Cross Platform Game
Development Using Phaser
3](http://phaser.io/shop/books/phaser3-cross-platform-games).

I have modified some of the source code to use ES6/7 and have added linting
using [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

I have also added Babel, webpack, et al. for bundling.
